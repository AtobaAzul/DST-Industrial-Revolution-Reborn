# DST-Industrial-Revolution-Reborn
Industrial Revolution is a mod that aims in implementing a new niche in gameplay: Automation 

Automation will serve as a new late-game goal while making megabases more practical & feasible.
Winona will also be reworked to work around that new niche.

Concepts:
- Automation
    - Some way to automate grass, twigs, logs, rocks, etc.
    - I think just basic automation like this should be implemented. Previously we attempted to make it focused on automation but A: Large-scale automation doesn't really work in DST. B: Frankly, in DST's current gameplay loop they wouldn't be very interesting or impactful.
    - Additionally, while I'd love complex, multi-building automation facilities I don't think it'll be feasible to do this with my current skill. The current solution is having the machines have a container, and having upgrades to refine it. 

- Power
    - Instead of making a new power system, I'll just reuse circuitnode component.
    - Power will be able to be automated and transmitted offscreen.
    - More generators

- Utilities
    - Like I said in the Automation topic, I'll shift the focus to power-based utilities.
    - Serious buffs to spotlight, rework the gem-erator into a utility structure
    - More serious, but not fully automated assemblers to some materials
    - A bunch more structures: Siren, Electric Motor, electric tools, Batt-pack, etc.
